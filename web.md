Best Design Principles \& Animation Suggestions:



Clean \& Minimalist Layout:



Design: Ample whitespace. Focus on readability and visual hierarchy. Let your work speak for itself.



Animation: Subtle transitions between sections, gentle hovers on interactive elements.



**Typography:**



Design: Choose 1-2 legible, complementary fonts. One for headings (maybe a display font), one for body text (a sans-serif or serif). Ensure good contrast with the background.



Animation:



Headline/Name: Text reveals (typing effect, or letters sliding in), or a slight scale/bounce on load.



**Color Palette:**



Design: Select 2-3 primary colors that reflect your brand/personality, along with neutral shades (grays, whites, blacks). Consistency is key.



Animation: Color changes on hover for buttons/links, subtle gradients that shift.



High-Quality Imagery/Visuals:



Design: Use professional photos (headshot), and crisp, well-cropped images for your project showcases.



**Animation:**



Hero Image/Background Video: A subtle, looping background video related to your work, or a high-res image with a parallax scroll effect.



Project Cards: Hover effects (e.g., image scales slightly, overlay appears with project details, subtle shadow depth increase).



Micro-interactions \& Subtle Animations:



Purpose: Enhance user experience, provide feedback, and add a polished feel.



**Suggestions:**



On Scroll: Elements fading in or sliding into view as the user scrolls down (e.g., "About" text, service icons, project cards). This keeps the page dynamic without being distracting.



Navigation: Smooth scroll to sections when a menu item is clicked. Hamburger menu animations.



Buttons: Subtle hover effects (background color change, slight scale, icon movement).



Forms: Input field highlights on focus.



Loading States: Custom loading animations for images or data (if applicable).



Example Visual Flow \& Animation Ideas:



**Hero Section:**



Page loads, your name/logo appears with a gentle fade/slide.



Headline types out or slides in from the left.



CTA button appears with a slight bounce or scale effect.



A subtle, slow-moving particle background or abstract shape animation in the background.
